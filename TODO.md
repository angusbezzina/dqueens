#### Other potential ideas for Danai, if she hasn't already considered them:

- Create and link a TikTok and YouTube account for D'Queens. Content that I think would do well would be:
    1. Instructional videos demonstrating how to prepare your hair and nails at home, or on a budget.
    2. Videos about the fashion trends for hair and nails at the moment in Latin America, Mexico and in Queretaro specifically.
    3. Videos where you recreate hair and nail styles from celebrities. You could even ask your followers to DM you with a celebrity "look" that they would like to have and pick a winner every month and give them that hair style or nail style for free, but record the transformation and put the content on Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, Pinterest, TikTok etc.
    4. Before and after client transformational videos.
    5. Videos or other content that shows the process of starting your own business and the successes and failures you have along the way. Lots of people want to start a business, but not many people document the process and I think this would be really interesting to a lot of people.

- I think it would be really cool to try and boost your audience by putting clients who come into the store and leave a Google review online for D'Queens into a raffle every month where they can win a free hair or nail style treatment.

- Remember that you can always film one piece of content, or make one piece of content and then edit it so that it is suitable for other platforms. For example, record a longer video and edit it for YouTube, then take screenshots from it for Instagram and Pinterest, you can also condense the video or take snippets of the video for TikTok etc. or even take the audio from the video and upload it as a podcast. Work smarter, not harder 😄.

This is an example change...
